# Tobacco Use Data Analysis
## In this analysis, I aim to answer two questions:
## ----> How has the rate of habitual smoking changed from 1995-2010?
## ----> How has the rate of historical non-smoking changed from 1995-2010?
## Summary:
## ----> Habitual smoking rates declined from about 20% to 12%
## ----> Historical non-smoking rates increased from about 52% to 57%
